    <h1>üî• QA Ninja & Software Integrity Guardian üî•</h1>
    <h2>10+ years slaying bugs and architecting bulletproof systems‚Äîfrom NASA space robots to mission-critical election
        tech.</h2>

    <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>ISTQB¬Æ-certified automation warlord: built Selenium/UFT/JMeter fortresses, slashed test cycles consistently,
            and championed WCAG-compliant democracy.
        <li>Cloud-savvy QA alchemist (AWS/Azure/Kubernetes) with a Master‚Äôs in Cloud Architecture‚Äîtaming big data beasts
            (Spark/Kafka) with zero-defect precision.
        <li>Full-stack chaos engineer: utilize REST Assured, Postman, and LoadRunner to break systems before they break
            Democracy, Healthcare, or Olive oil start-ups.
        <li>DevOps whisperer: Forged CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins/Git) that ship cleaner code faster‚Äîbecause ‚ÄúQA bottleneck‚Äù
            isn‚Äôt in my vocabulary.
        <li>Polyglot tech diplomat: bridged QA and Dev trenches in Agile/Scrum wars -made ‚Äúbug-free‚Äù a boardroom KPI.

        <li>Trained teams, helped coders, and rallied SHPE engineers to build awesome tech that doesn‚Äôt just work‚Äîwows.

        <li>Data brawler: Stress-tested systems into submission with LoadRunner, then dissected APIs via Postman/Swagger
            like a digital coroner.
        <li>Hybrid QA/DevOps warrior‚Äîtranslates to any stack, any team, any chaos.
        <li>A knack for breaking what devs swore was unbreakable. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you even THINK of that test case?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
            Tuesday.‚Äù
